* Alan AI will take you to the page which displays all the news headings.
* Alan AI will ask you if you want Alan AI to read the News.
   * If you say 'YES', Alan AI will start reading the news and move forward to next articles.
   * The Page will automatically scroll down as the Alan AI moves down to articles and a Border-Bottom will be shown on the article that Alan AI is reading.
   * If you say 'NO', then nothing will happen.

* If you want to read a particular article:
   * Say for example, 'OPEN ARTICLE NUMBER 3'. Then the App will direct you to the page of that particluar Article.

* If you want to go back to previous Page:
   * Say 'GO BACK', and the App will redirect to the previous page.

* Technology Used: React, Alan AI.
* (I have written the backend code at  https://alan.app/platform but I have given a snippet of the code that is written in the file Backend_Code.js in the src folder).
